/// Encapsulates the logic that determines the order in which tracks will be selected for playback.
///
/// Track playback order depends on:
/// * the order of tracks in the playlist from which the sequence was created (i.e. the playback scope)
/// * the repeat and shuffle modes
///
/// This is a linear playback sequence that is unaware of the scope (entire playlist or specific group) from
/// which the sequence was created. The size of the sequence will equal the number of tracks in the
/// playback scope, and the indexes will represent absolute indexes within the sequence, that do not necessarily
/// correspond to playlist indexes.
///
/// Examples:
///
/// * If the scope was "All tracks" and there were 5 tracks in the playlist, the sequence might
/// look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] or if shuffle is selected, maybe [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]
///
/// * If the scope was "Artist: Madonna" and there were 3 tracks in the Madonna artist group,
/// the sequence might look like [0, 1, 2] or if shuffle is selected, maybe [2, 0, 1] ... regardless
/// of how many total tracks or groups there are in the entire playlist.
