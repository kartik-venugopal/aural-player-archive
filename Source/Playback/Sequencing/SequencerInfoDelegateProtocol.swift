/// A functional contract for a delegate that represents the Sequencer and retrieves information
/// about the Sequencer, such as the playback sequence, current track, repeat / shuffle modes, etc.

/// Acts as a middleman between clients and the Sequencer, providing a simplified
/// interface / facade for clients to access information from the Sequencer.
///
/// This contract only defines accessors, no mutators, so clients of this protocol cannot make
/// any changes to the Sequencer's state. It is intended to be used by components that display
/// Player information.
