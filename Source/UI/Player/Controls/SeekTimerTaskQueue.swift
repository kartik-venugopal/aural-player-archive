/*
    Utility class for submitting tasks to the "seek timer" that acts as a clock and triggers regular periodic UI updates as the player seeks through a track.
 
    This is needed by any external view wishing to synchronize its updates with the seek timer (so as not to create another timer instance which is resource-intensive).
