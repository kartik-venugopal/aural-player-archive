## Overview

Aural Player is an audio player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with support for a wide variety of popular audio formats and powerful sound tuning capabilities.

| With Winamp-like modularity and multiple app presentation modes, you can lay out the app to suit your workspace, reduce it to a tiny widget, or tuck it away in the macOS menu bar. | Personalize Aural Player with exactly the colors and fonts that define your creative tastes. |

| Extensive audio formats support  | Sound tuning and monitoring |

| By harnessing the power of FFmpeg, Aural Player supports a wide variety of popular audio formats, in addition to all macOS Core Audio formats. | With several built-in effects and support for Audio Unit (AU) plug-ins, sound tuning and monitoring possibilities are endless. |

### How it works (under the hood)

Aural Player uses **AVFoundation's AVAudioEngine** framework (and some low-level **Core Audio**) for playback, effects, and visualization, and uses **FFmpeg** libraries to decode formats not native to macOS.

The UI is built on top of AppKit with views defined in XIBs (no SwiftUI).

The code is written entirely in Swift (approximately 100,000 lines of code).

Read more about it [here](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Developer-reference).

### Limitations

* Currently, Aural does not play online streams. However, this feature has been requested and I am strongly considering implementing it for version 4.x.
* Aural does not play protected content (for example, Apple's M4P or Audible's AAX). There are no plans to implement this.

## Key features

(Comprehensive feature list [here](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Features))

* Supports all [Core Audio formats](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX.html) and several non-native formats: FLAC, Vorbis, Monkey's Audio (APE), Opus, & [many more](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Features#audio-formats)
* Supports M3U / M3U8 playlists
* **Playback:** Bookmarking, segment looping, custom seek intervals, per-track last position memory, chapters support, autoplay, resume last played track.

### Roadmap

The app (v3.x) is currently in maintenance mode - bugs will be fixed and small enhancements may be made.

#### Version 4.0

As of Jan 12, 2024, version 4.0 is being actively developed. I am aiming to release v4.0 by the summer of 2024 - June / July-ish.

Interested in seeing what's going on with the development of v4.0 ? Check out [the v4.0 branch](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/tree/v4.0)!

------------------------------------------------------

In addition to v4.0, the following features ***may be*** implemented in the future:

- Replay gain.
- Crossfading between tracks.
- Gapless playback.

#### Other goals

- More comprehensive documentation.
- Better source code commenting.

### Compatibility

This table lists the range of compatible Aural Player versions for your hardware and macOS version. Unless you are using macOS 10.12 Sierra, it is always recommended to use the [latest](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/latest) app version, regardless of your hardware / macOS version.

|              | Intel (x86_64)  | Apple silicon (arm64)|
| :---:        | :-:             | :-:       |
| macOS 10.12 Sierra (no longer supported) | [3.16.0](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/tag/v3.16.0)           | (N/A)     |
| macOS 10.13 - 10.15 | [3.16.0](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/tag/v3.16.0) - [latest](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/latest)         | (N/A)     |
| macOS 11+  | [3.16.0](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/tag/v3.16.0) - [latest](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/latest)           | [3.16.0](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/tag/v3.16.0) - [latest](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/latest)|

**NOTES:** 

* Version 3.0.0 and all subsequent releases are universal binaries, i.e. capable of running on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

* Due to limited time, I can only officially support macOS Big Sur and Monterey going forward. The app should still work on older systems (going back to Sierra), but I can no longer make guarantees or troubleshoot issues on older systems.

### Installation

1. Mount the **AuralPlayer-x.y.z.dmg** image file.
2. From within the mounted image, copy **Aural.app** to your local drive (e.g. **Applications** folder).
3. Run the copy from your local drive. You will likely see a security warning and the app will not open because the app's developer is not recognized by macOS.
4. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open anyway**, to allow Aural.app to open.

NOTE - Please ***don't*** run the app directly from within the image. Copy it outside and run the copy.

### Media keys support

Your Mac media keys should work with Aural right out of the box (assuming you granted Aural Accessibility permissions on first app launch), but if for some reason the media keys don't work, follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Enabling-media-keys-support).

## Building the app

All you need is Xcode 12.2+ and the [source code](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/releases/latest) (a working knowledge of Swift would help !). It is recommended to use the source code from the latest release (as opposed to the master branch) as code between releases can be buggy / unstable.

Read the [quick start guide](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Building-and-running-Aural-Player-(quick-start-guide)) for more details.

**Email:** [kartikv2017@gmail.com](mailto:kartikv2017@gmail.com)

**GitHub Issues** https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/issues.

The app is what it is today largely thanks to the numerous bug reports and valuable feedback of users over the years. I urge you to file issues for any bugs you encounter or for features / behavior you would like to see implemented. I am generally pretty good at responding to issues, and at the very least, I will read, contemplate, and respond.

## How to contribute

Interested in contributing to this awesome project ?!

I would love to localize Aural Player so that it is more comfortable to use for users who prefer other languages. I could definitely use help translating Aural Player's text into languages such as German, French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, etc (and any others that you can help with).

Please [email me](mailto:kartikv2017@gmail.com) if you're interested in helping with this !

NOTE - I am ***not*** looking for help with app development at the moment, but if this changes, I will post an update.
